hw3-naive folder includes:

tourist_problem_class.py: this is the class that I created for that problem. Naive recursion algorithm is in it. 

naive.py: This file contains the main code and 5 instances for the blackbox testing, by commenting out other four, you can test them. 

naive-test.py: This file contains the performance analysis for naive algorithm only. Resulting graph is in the section d, in the report. 

dp-naive-comparion.py: This file contains the performance analysis for naive and dp algorithms and results are plotted on the same graph. Resulting graph is in the report also.

hw3-DP folder includes:

hw3_DP.py: This file contains the main code and 5 instances for the blackbox testing, by commenting out other four, you can test them. 

hw3_DP_test.py: This file contains the performance analysis for dynamic programming algorithm only. Resulting graph is in the section d, in the report.
